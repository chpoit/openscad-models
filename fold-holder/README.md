# Galaxy Z Fold 3 mount for controllers

This is a simple sideways phone mount for the galaxy Z Fold 3 that can be used with the S-Pen case and that is designed to be used with a controller mount that has "GoPro" style mounts, [such as this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2553522).

You may need to tweak the "flapWidth" variable, but 2.4 or 2.5 should be perfectly fine.

I only printed the "Xbox controller mount" part of the linked controller mount.

Thanks to Julietta for [this GoPro mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3088912) from which I yoinked the elements I needed and allowed for parametric flap width.

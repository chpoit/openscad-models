# Fan lid for the voron 2.4 exhaust

This is a lid for the Voron 2.4 exhaust if you don't want a fan.

# License
I tok all the measurements by hand. If that counts as "clean room engineering" then this is licensed under MIT, because copyleft is a plague on all things opensource. 
If it is not "clean room engineering" and counts as a derivative, this falls under whatever GPL version the Voron team uses.

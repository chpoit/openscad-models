# openscad-models

A couple of openscad 3d models I made.


# Licenses

Where otherwise specified, either in the readme, the comments of a specific file, or a LICENSE file in any subfolder, everything that I created falls under the license in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file. Currently, and likely forever, that is the MIT License. Obviously you don't have to add a copy of the license to all your 3d models, that would be silly.
